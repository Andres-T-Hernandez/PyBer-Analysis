# Module 5 |  PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to do a more detailed analysis on PyBer rideshare data from January to May 2019.  In particular this analysis does a comparison of city types: 
 - Rural    
 - Suburban    
 - Urban
 
Through tracking data on total rides, total drivers, and total fares

## Results

As we can see from the data, there are significant differences between city types.  There is significantly more volume in both rides and drivers from rural to suburban to urban.  However even though the average fare per ride is progressively lower between the rural-suburban-urban divide, there is progressively more fares.  The Average fare per driver is also progressively lower, and this draws attention to the ration of total rides to drivers also decreasing with urban cities even having more drivers than rides.  Finally, a comparison of fares by dates indicates that fares remained steady by type throughout the year.

## Summary
Based on the results of this summary there are three recommendations
 1. Reduce the amount of drivers in urban cities.  Having more drivers then rides may be driving down total fares 
 2. Increase the amount of drivers in rural and slightly in suburban cities.  Its possible the amount of rides are hitting a limit if there are not enough drivers available
 3. Decrease the price of each ride in rural and perhaps suburban cities.  As we can see from urban centers volume in total rides can make up for lower fares per ride.
